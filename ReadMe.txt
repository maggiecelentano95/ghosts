Ghosts of Future Past: The Search For Clyde is a side-scrolling, co-op multiplayer platform puzzle game with a clear winning and losing state. As the name suggests, the objective of the game is to search for Clyde, the little yellow ghost. In order to do this, the player has to complete three levels of progressive difficulty. 

The game consists of two players, Inky (the blue ghost) and Blinky (the red ghost). Each of these ghosts can be controlled by different players. The goal is to make these ghosts work together to solve puzzles in each level, and progress to the next level.

Within each level is a key that has to be collected, obstacles, enemy ghosts and fruits. The levels also contain a door which is unlocked using the key. This door takes you to the next level. Each of the levels also has multiple portals which reverse the gravity. This makes the game fun and tricky as the players have to go through these portals in order to kill the enemies and progress through the level. 
Enemies have two parts to them:  A blue part, and a white part. The white part is where they are vulnerable. In order to kill the enemy, have one of the players touch the white part of the enemy. A fruit will then spawn that the player can collect. Touching the blue part of the enemy will hurt the player. Be careful, you only have 3 lives!

On gameplay: The players can jump, stand on top of each other, and go through portals that are spread throughout the level. These portals reverse the players gravity. The two players must figure out how they should move through these portals in order to advance through the level. 
Certain strategies include:
1.) Gaining momentum boost by going through the portal after falling from a high distance (this strategy can especially be seen at the beginning of level 2
2.) Having one player stand on top of the otherss head in order to gain more height. You can even have the grounded player jump, and then have the player on top jump once the bottom player has gained height.
3.) You need the key to the door before the door at the end of the level will take you to he next level. The keys are not too hard to find. Look out for them towards the end of the level. 

In level 3, there are blue portals and red portals. Only the blue player can go through the blue portal, and only the red player can go through the red portal.

Level Select Screen: On the menu screen, you will see a level select button. This will take you to the level select screen, where you can choose to play one of the three main levels, or play the bonus levels. Level select screen also shows the high score of each level.
Controls: Arrows for Red player, WAD for blue player
